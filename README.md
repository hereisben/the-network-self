# 🌱 The Networked Plant Project

**Live demo:** https://the-network-self.onrender.com/

A real-time, browser-based net art project where each visitor grows a digital plant through presence and interaction. As more users join, a shared forest forms, reflecting collective activity over time.

This project explores how identity, mood, and presence can exist and persist in a shared online space.
