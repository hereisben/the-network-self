This is a real-time, browser-based experience where each visitor helps grow a digital plant by simply moving their cursor. As more people join and grow their plants, a collective forest forms — showing how we grow together.

- 🌻 A shared counter tracks how many users have reached full bloom.
- 💬 Anonymous whispers float across the screen.
